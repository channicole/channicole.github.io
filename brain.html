							<p>If I could have everything I wanted, what would that look like?</p>

							<p>I’d continue to <b>create.</b> <i>Write, play music, draw or paint, craft, bake, sew or knit, take photos, machine, 3D print, program, print and assemble circuit boards.</i></p>

							<p>I’d do something that fills a need. <i>(Let’s not create arbitrary markets, artificial problems, and chase after jobs with the framework to give us wealth, fame, and career advancement.) What are genuine problems that currently exist? What is being done to address them? Do you agree with the approach? Do you have something to offer to the cause? Why do you care about it?</i></p>

							<p>I’d have a nice, comfortable, clean home. I’d have friends who feel comfortable sharing our homes and meals and lives with me. I’d keep company from work, from the past, from whatever new shenanigans I’m into, from traveling and couch surfing. I’d have time to enjoy cleaning, cooking, exercising, sleeping, and being lazy–clumping in time to do girl maintenance, go shopping, watch Netflix, read a book, call up the fam.</p>
